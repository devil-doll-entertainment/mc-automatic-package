# Contributing to MC-AutomaticPackage

Contributions are welcome — bugs, fixes, features, or documentation.
This document covers how to work with the project as a contributor.

---

## Before You Start

- Search [existing issues](https://github.com/devil-doll-entertainment/mc-automatic-package/issues) before opening a new one.
- For significant changes, open an issue first to discuss the direction before writing code.
- Read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). It applies to all interactions in this project.

---

## Reporting a Bug

Open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/devil-doll-entertainment/mc-automatic-package/issues/new/choose) using the bug report template.

Include:
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Steps to reproduce
- Environment details (OS, runtime version, relevant config)

---

## Proposing a Feature

Open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/devil-doll-entertainment/mc-automatic-package/issues/new/choose) using the feature request template, or submit a PR directly if the change is small and self-contained.

For larger features, an issue discussion first avoids wasted effort on both sides.

---

## Workflow

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
2. Name your branch descriptively — `fix/cooldown-on-toggle`, `feat/search-filter`.
3. Make your changes.
4. Run `just check` to verify all quality gates pass.
5. Open a pull request against `main` with a clear description of what changed and why.

---

## Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting:

- [ ] The project builds without errors (`just check`)
- [ ] Changes are described in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) under `[Unreleased]`
- [ ] The PR description explains what changed and why
- [ ] New behavior is covered by tests where applicable
